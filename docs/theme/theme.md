## Site Theme
This file serves as a documentation of the theme / style I am aiming for.

### Pixel art
As I am no artist or have much creativity, the game element will be made in a pixel art style as there exist a plethora of tools to generate and create pixel art assets. Additionally there is a lot of great work I can take inspiration from.

### The assets
The following is a rough idea of how I imagine the assets. It is mostly a collection of images serving as a theme mood board.

#### The character
For the character I want an image of myself in the shape of an ellipsis with detached hands and feet.

The sprite is self-made. The hands and feet need some colors, shading and detail. Also the size relation is subject to change.

#### The environment
The foreground has to be some sort of walking surface and some layer beneath such as dirt.
The background can be a sky with some clouds.
Perhaps in the middleground there can be some grass straws.
Ideally, all the layers will be moving at different speeds to give a depth perception i.e., the further back elements move slower.

This image is generated by DALL-E 3. I like the vibrant colors, so I'll likely go with a similar style, I just need to separate the layers to have them move independently.

#### The milestone entity
When reaching a milestone I want there to be an entity associated with it. An example could be graduating university, it would make sense to have a building.

This image is generated by DALL-E 3.

#### The milestone descriptions
For a milestone I want there to be an object, which when collided with, will trigger to display the relevant description for that particular milestone. I was first considering a scroll unwrapping with the text on. This is quite generic. Another approach, that I like more, is to have an object relevant to the particular milestone be displayed in front of the milestone entity. For the university example this could be a graduation hat.

Image is found on google images. The text could then be displayed in the sky or perhaps on a scroll still that shows up. I was also thinking to have the character collects these objects. This could give a sense of progression, especially if the character wears / holds the items collected. Another example could be a medal for finishing my first marathon. With this approach I would have to somehow make the text stay after the object is collected.
